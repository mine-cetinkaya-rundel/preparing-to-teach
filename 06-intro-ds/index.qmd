# About me

## My teaching background

-   PhD at UCLA: Lots of intro stat TAing, found a passion for thinking about how people learn and how to better meet their needs

-   Faculty at Duke:

    -   First 3 years: Focus on intro stat, focusing on infusing modern methods and computing into the curriculum

    -   4th year onward (including 2 year stint at University of Edinburgh): Focus on intro data science and tool building *(but still actively thinking about intro stat too...)*

# Principles for design

## Baking a cake {.center}

Imagine you're new to baking, and you're in a baking class.
I'm going to present two options for starting the class.
Which one gives you **better sense** of the final product?

## Design foundation 1: Backwards design

Set goals for educational curriculum before choosing instructional methods + forms of assessment

1.  Identify desired results
2.  Determine acceptable evidence
3.  Plan learning experiences and instruction

2016 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education

1.  Teach statistical thinking.
    -   Teach statistics as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision making.

    -   Give students experience with multivariable thinking \[...\] to answer challenging questions that require them to investigate and explore relationships among many variables.

2.  Focus on conceptual understanding.
3.  Integrate real data with a context and purpose.
4.  Foster active learning.
5.  Use technology to explore concepts and analyse data.
6.  Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning.

2017 Park City Math Institute Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Data Science

> Students will immediately use a high-level language to explore, visualize, and pose questions about data.
> In the second semester, a more algorithmic language may be introduced to help students understand the thinking and structure behind the higher-level functions they experienced in the first semester.

-   Introduction to high-level language
-   Exploring and manipulating data
-   Functions and basic coding
-   Introduction to modeling, both deterministic and stochastic
-   Concepts of projects and code management
-   Databases
-   Introduction to data collection and statistical inference

## Designing code snippets for teaching

-   Write it out to your heart's desire and polish it

-   Then, split into three parts:

    -   **Pre-process:** Required, but isn't directly connected to / far off from learning goals of current lesson
    -   **Stash:** Not required, and not directly connected to learning goals of current lesson
        -   Likely concepts that fit better into future lessons)
    -   **Feature:** Heart of the lesson (and maybe a review of a previous lessons)

-   Finally, decide on the pace at which to scaffold and layer

## Pre-process

We'll call the highlighted lines `us_votes`

Estimate the difference between the average evaluation score of male and female faculty.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
evals |>
  specify(score ~ gender) |>
  generate(reps = 100, 
    type = "bootstrap") |>
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", 
    order = c("male", "female")) |>
  summarise(
    l = quantile(stat, 0.025), 
    u = quantile(stat, 0.975)

  dplyr.print_max = 6

## infer $\in$ tidymodels

::: {.column width="50%"}
The objective of this package is to perform statistical inference using an expressive statistical grammar that coheres with the tidyverse design framework.

## One other way to "leverage the ecosystem"

Do it all in R!

-   Slides, course, course notes / textbook with **Quarto**
-   A student dashboard with **flexdashboard**
-   Git automation with **ghclass**
-   Interactive tutorials with **learnr**
-   ...

# Assessing learning

## Pieces of assessment

-   Formative: In-class exercises, interactive tutorials, etc.

-   Summative: Homework assignments, lab assignments, exams, projects, etc.

## Individual vs. team

::: question
-   How do you create a learning environment that is conducive to teamwork?
-   How do you balance learning as a team with learning individually?
:::

# Teaching resources

## LOTS of open teaching materials!

-   The landscape of data science education is evolving, which demands that instructors stay up-to-date, ever-learning

-   The tooling supports and facilitates open sharing

-   The data science education community is generous!

::: callout-tip
## Tip

Look for open course materials and learn about and respect the license.
All the presenters in this room share their materials openly.
